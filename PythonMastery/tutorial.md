In Python, class member variables (attributes) and member functions (methods) can be defined as public, private, or protected based on naming conventions:

### Public Members
Public members are accessible from outside the class. By default, all members are public unless explicitly specified otherwise.

#### Example:
```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.public_var = "I am public"
    
    def public_method(self):
        return "This is a public method"

# Accessing public members
obj = MyClass()
print(obj.public_var)  # Output: I am public
print(obj.public_method())  # Output: This is a public method
```

### Private Members
Private members are intended to be inaccessible from outside the class. They are defined by prefixing the member name with two underscores (`__`).

#### Example:
```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__private_var = "I am private"
    
    def __private_method(self):
        return "This is a private method"
    
    def access_private_members(self):
        return self.__private_method(), self.__private_var

# Accessing private members within the class
obj = MyClass()
print(obj.access_private_members())  # Output: ('This is a private method', 'I am private')

# Attempting to access private members directly (will cause an error)
# print(obj.__private_var)  # AttributeError
# print(obj.__private_method())  # AttributeError
```

**Note:** Python uses name mangling to make private members harder to access. The private member `__private_var` is internally changed to `_MyClass__private_var`. This is intended to prevent accidental access and modification, not to ensure strict access control.

### Protected Members
Protected members are accessible within the class and its subclasses. They are defined by prefixing the member name with a single underscore (`_`).

#### Example:
```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self._protected_var = "I am protected"
    
    def _protected_method(self):
        return "This is a protected method"

# Accessing protected members
obj = MyClass()
print(obj._protected_var)  # Output: I am protected
print(obj._protected_method())  # Output: This is a protected method
```

### Summary
- **Public Members:** No prefix. Accessible from anywhere.
- **Protected Members:** Single underscore (`_`). Intended to be accessible within the class and its subclasses.
- **Private Members:** Double underscore (`__`). Intended to be inaccessible from outside the class due to name mangling.

These conventions help in indicating the intended level of access control for different class members in Python.
